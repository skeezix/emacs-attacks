;; a classic 'noise' based map generator
;; a low level threshold -> water
;; as you go up level threshholds .. water, plains, grassland, mountain .. something like that

;; continents cookie cutter option .. drop some blob minimum size, grow outwards from there until
;; some depth value is found? drop cutouts onto an all-water layer?

;; hmm, write a perlkin noise function, or just invoke external python job .. hmmm..
