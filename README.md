Simple top-down wargame for Emacs

Why:
- .. because we needed a wargame in Emacs right? People can't complain there isn't one anymore!
- I wanted to learn Lisp and elisp in particular; failed spectacularly - this is not written in idiomatic lisp, and uses all terrible conventions. Thats what you get when hacking round at 2am .. but it works :)

Contributing:
- all are welcome!
- check the license - currently aiming for GPLv3 on all assets for maximum compatibility with Emacs itself
- we especially need the following I think:
  - Artists - I've swiped some tiles from Freeciv for now (I believe GPLv3 but didn't keep notes), so I'd like to replace the tiles with new art so we're not in question of ownership
  - elisp - Mapscripts need writing, to generate fresh maps rather than the dumb demo ones I've made
  - elisp - AI scripts for the NPC units

Emacs version:
- Tested on Emacs 27.1
- Currently requires GUI mode Emacs, until we fix/write the text interface

Required packages:
- posframe
- ..

To Do:
- much is to be done, this is very rudimentary so far! Not worth listing what is to do, because far more needs to be done than is done!
