# emacs-attacks
Simple top-down wargame for Emacs

Currently requires Emacs in GUI mode, though planned to fix the text mode interface. (Currently the side-bar detail panel is using a posframe floating box which likely isn't supported in text mode Emacs.)

Call for assistance! All are welcome to contribute!
Especially..
- Artists - I've swiped some tiles from Freeciv for now (I believe GPLv3 but didn't keep notes), so I'd like to replace the tiles with new art so we're not in question of ownership
- elisp - Mapscripts need writing, to generate fresh maps rather than the dumb demo ones I've made
- elisp - AI scripts for the NPC units

Emacs version:
- Tested on Emacs 27.1

Required packages:
- posframe

To Do:
- much is to be done, this is very rudimentary so far!
